# ðŸš€ **Multi-modal RAG System** ðŸš€


A **Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System** that processes **text, tables, and images** to provide relevant information. This system is designed to handle diverse document types and retrieve not just text but also **relevant images and tables** based on the input query.

### **Key Components**  
Hereâ€™s what powers the system:  
- **Gemini**: Llm engine
- **LangChain**: To build modular RAG pipelines.  
- **Unstructured-IO**: For processing & parcing various document formats.  

The system extracts and summarizes content from documents, then uses a **multi-vector retriever** to fetch the most relevant information, ensuring the response includes the appropriate context from the document.  

### **Why Itâ€™s Useful**  
This system is particularly helpful for:  
âœ… **Handling queries** that involve multiple data types.  
âœ… **Providing richer responses** by including relevant images and tables.  
âœ… **Applications in industries** like healthcare, finance, and education, where data is often multimodal.  


### **Challenges & Learnings**  
Building this system involved addressing challenges like computational complexity and integrating different modalities. Itâ€™s been a great learning experience and has opened up new areas for exploration.  




Looking forward to connecting and exploring new opportunities!
